    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A take on southern Vietnamese pho, this is a comforting bowl of rich,
      spiced beef broth ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef. Serve
      it with hoiPsin sauce, sriracha sauce, green onion, cilantro, bean
      sprouts, basil, and lime.
    </p>
    <h2>Beef Pho Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Beef bones and tough beef cuts: Beef pho broth usually involves leg and
        knuckle bones which lend beefy flavor and fat. Tough beef cuts may
        include oxtail (as Lett101 calls for in this recipe), which contributes
        its collagen for a rich mouthfeel; beef brisket, chuck, or other kinds
        of stewy cuts may be substituted, if you prefer boneless meat. Use what
        fits into your budget and is freshest at the store.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flat rice noodles: These are similar to the ones used for pad Thai. They
        may be labeled banh pho at the supermarket or Asian grocer. Dried banh
        pho last a long time in the cupboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Aromatics: Ginger, onion (or shallot) lend sweet-spicy zip and a little
        pungent note too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spices: The spicing varies from cook to cook. For beef pho, there is
        typically star anise, cinnamon/cassia sticks, and clove. Here, Lett101
        adds peppercorns for a pungent note. Regardless, make sure you use star
        anise with robust points so your broth gets lots of its savor. Each star
        anise has 8 points. It is okay to use broken ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        Daikon: Adding daikon naturally adds earthy sweetness to the broth.
        Substitute turnip if you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt, sugar, and fish sauce: These are the foundational pho seasonings.
        For the sugar, Chinese yellow rock sugar is often used for southern
        Vietnamese-style pho broth; if you donâ€™t have it, use granulated sugar
        (organic has a deeper flavor than white granulated sugar). A sweetener
        helps to round out pho broth flavor. Fish sauce, sold at many
        supermarkets and Asian markets, adds umami savoriness to the broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Steak: Choose a tender cut of steak. Splurge on marbled meat and slice
        it thin so it will be cooked quickly by the hot broth. If you do not
        like raw-ish meat, omit it and focus on the cooked beef!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><strong>Step 1 :</strong> Gather all ingredients.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2 :</strong> Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or
      larger) pot; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and
      bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3 :</strong> Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from
      the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting
      pan with aluminum foil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4 :</strong> Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the
      prepared roasting pan and cook under the preheated broiler, stirring
      occasionally, until vegetables are charred, 10 to 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5 :</strong> Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and slice
      ginger; set aside separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6 :</strong> Skim fat from surface of simmering broth. Add
      oxtail, radish, and charred onions to broth. Tie charred ginger, anise,
      cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in cheesecloth to make a bouquet
      garni; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 teaspoons
      salt. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the
      better). Season with salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7 :</strong> Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni.
      Reserve meat from bones for another use. Chill broth in the refrigerator,
      8 hours to overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 8 :</strong> Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled
      broth. Pour broth into a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep hot
      until ready to serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 9 :</strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat.
      Stir in rice noodles and let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy, 6 to
      10 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 10 :</strong> Meanwhile, cut frozen sirloin into paper-thin
      slices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 11 :</strong> Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1
      1/2 cups per serving. Top each with a few sirloin slices. Ladle hot broth
      over sirloin and noodles.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 12 :</strong> Serve and enjoy!</p>
